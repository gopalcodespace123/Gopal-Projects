                <h2><u>Missile Man Of India</u></h2>
                <p>
                    <b> Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam </b>is known as the Missile man of India due to his contributions to the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. When he returned to the DRDO in 1982, he oversaw a programme that resulted
                    in a number of successful missiles, earning him the moniker Missile Man.. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal
                    organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both
                    the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was
                    a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest
                    on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.
